**Live Site URL**: [https://hobbyhub-a10.netlify.app/]

HobbyHub is a community-driven platform that empowers users to explore, create, and engage in local hobby-based groups such as book clubs, hiking crews, or art circles. Built using modern React tools, Firebase authentication, and a beautiful responsive design with Tailwind and DaisyUI, this project connects like-minded individuals based on shared interests.

##  Key Features

- **Secure Authentication**  
  Email-password login system with Google sign-in. All protected routes are secured with Firebase Auth.

- **Create and Manage Groups**  
  Logged-in users can create, update, and delete hobby groups with categories, descriptions, and member limits.

- **Dynamic Group Status**  
  Groups with past start dates are marked as inactive and cannot be joined—ensuring real-time group availability.

- **Fully Responsive & Themed UI**  
  Built with Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI and supports Dark/Light mode toggle for seamless viewing on all devices.

- **Interactive UI Elements**  
  Smooth animations with `react-awesome-reveal`, typing effects with `react-simple-typewriter`, and beautiful popups using `SweetAlert2`.
